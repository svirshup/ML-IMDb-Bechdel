# Using Machine Learning to Predict Female Representation in Movies
By Scott Virshup

This repo consists of a python jupyter notebook that goes through the process of downloading the public IMDb Dataset as well as making a call to the Bechdel Test API. The Bechdel Test is a subjective score given to movies that can be one of four things.
* Score of 0 means the movie didn't even have two named women in the cast
* Score of 1 means the movie had two named women in the cast
* Score of 2 means those women talked to each other
* Score of 3 means that those women talked to each other about something other than men

The goal of this notebook is to:
1. Teach readers how to perform some of the tasks outlined. Generally the comments are pretty clear and comprehensive for each step
2. Train a machine learning model to predict Bechdel Test scores for movies, given parameters that are available in the IMDb Public Dataset
3. Apply that model to the IMDb dataset, and analyize the results of the predictions that it provides.


Please use NB Viewer to view the notebook's visualizations. They're created in bokeh, which does not show up in github for some reason.
